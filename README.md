# Metric Learning using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs)

The code in this repository implements a metric learning approach for irregular
graphs. The method has been applied on brain connectivity networks and is
presented in our papers:

There is also implementations of the filters and graph coarsening used in:

  Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09375), Neural

The implementaton of the global loss function is based on:

  Siamese and Triplet Convolutional Networks by Minimising Global Loss Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09272),

## Installation
### Run from Google Colab
Open `gcn_metric_learning.ipynb` and run all

### Run in other environments
1. Clone this repository. Then:
   ```sh
   cd gcn_metric_learning
   ```

2. Install the dependencies. Please edit `requirements.txt` to choose the
   TensorFlow version (CPU / GPU, Linux / Mac) you want to install, or install
   it beforehand. (This code runs on tensorflow 1.x)
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or make install
   ```
3. The root folder in fetch_data.py (line 27) and ABIDEParser.py (line 33) has to be updated to the folder were the data will be stored.

4. To download ABIDE datasets, obtain missing `subject_IDs.txt` and `mat` file,
   by using script from [parisots](https://github.com/parisots/population-gcn), run code below:
   ```sh
   python fetch_data.py
   ```

5. Run the code
   ```sh
   python main_all_sites.py
   ```


## Using the model

To use our siamese graph ConvNet on your data, you need:

1. pairs of graphs as matrices where each row is a node and each column is a node feature,
2. a class label for each graph,
3. an adjacency matrix which provides the structure as a graph; the same structure
   will be used for all samples.

Please get in touch if you are unsure about applying the model to a different
setting.
