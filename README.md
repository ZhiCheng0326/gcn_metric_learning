# Metric Learning using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs)

The code in this repository implements a metric learning approach for irregular
graphs. The method has been applied on brain connectivity networks and is
presented in our papers:

There is also implementations of the filters and graph coarsening used in:

  Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09375), Neural

The implementaton of the global loss function is based on:

  Siamese and Triplet Convolutional Networks by Minimising Global Loss Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09272),

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sk1712/gcn_metric_learning
   cd gcn_metric_learning
   ```

2. Install the dependencies. Please edit `requirements.txt` to choose the
   TensorFlow version (CPU / GPU, Linux / Mac) you want to install, or install
   it beforehand. (This code runs on tensorflow 1.x)
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # or make install
   ```
3. To download ABIDE datasets, obtain missing `subject_IDs.txt` and `mat` file, by using script from [parisots](https://github.com/parisots/population-gcn), run code below:
```sh
python fetch_data.py
```

4. Run the code
```sh
python main_all_sites.py
```


## Using the model

To use our siamese graph ConvNet on your data, you need:

1. pairs of graphs as matrices where each row is a node and each column is a node feature,
2. a class label for each graph,
3. an adjacency matrix which provides the structure as a graph; the same structure
   will be used for all samples.

Please get in touch if you are unsure about applying the model to a different
setting.
